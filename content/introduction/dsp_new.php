<h2 id="new">What's New</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>EVERY REPRESENTATION A URI</strong><br/>Following REST principles, most request variables are now part of the URI path. Display manipulations of the resource are made with query string parameters.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>AUTHENTICATION VIA OAUTH 2.0</strong><br/>We use the latest OAuth 2 implementation, using Bearer header tokens for authentication purposes.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>MORE RESPONSE HEADER INFO</strong><br/>We introduced cross origin resource sharing (CORS) headers along with rate limit information (look for "X-Rate-*"), Shallow ETags, Version Information and more.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER</strong><br/>HTTP headers determine what representation to give a client, for example <a href="#versioning">versioning</a> is now controlled by the Accept header: "Accept: application/vnd.org.sample-1+json".</li><br/>
	<li><strong>EXPANDED DOCUMENTATION</strong><br/>We are expanding our documentation and will include a growing library of <a href="#code">sample code</a> to get your applications off the ground.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>HATEOAS FOUNDATIONS</strong><br/>Though not a full, self-discoverable HATEOAS API, we are on our way. This documentation is now generated from endpoint reflection.</li>
</ul>
